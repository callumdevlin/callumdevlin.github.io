I’m Callum Devlin, a Product Design Engineering MEng student from Glasgow. My work sits at the intersection of mechanical design and electronics - from automotive components and rotary engines to phased-array antenna hardware and embedded systems.

I’m comfortable moving between CAD, FEA, hands-on prototyping and software, and I enjoy projects where I can design something, build it, and then prove it works. I’ve spent time rebuilding and desiging parts for Mazda rotary engines, designing mechanical hardware for antennas, machining parts, wiring up embedded systems and writing Python/C++.

Away from uni and work, I like tinkering in my workshop (wood, metal, whatever’s available), working on my project car, building PCs and speed-solving Rubik’s cubes. 

If you’re interested in the software side of what I do, you can also check out my programming projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/callumdevlin).
