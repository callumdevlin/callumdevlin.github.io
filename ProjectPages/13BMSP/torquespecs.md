### Core Engine Fasteners

| Fastener |Torque Value (Nm)| Size (mm) | Notes | 
|:------------|:----------:|:-----------:|:-----------|
| Tension bolts (through-bolts) | 31.4–39.2 |  | Tighten in 2–3 passes in the specified sequence. | 
| Flywheel / counterweight locknut | 392–490 | 54 | Red Loctite; lock flywheel/counterweight with SST while tightening. | 
| Oil pump sprocket / shaft locknut | 31.4–46.1 |  | Use new lock washer, then bend tabs after torque. | 
| Front cover to housing bolts | 18.6–25.5 |  | Tighten in sequence after checking pulley boss height. | 
| Pulley lock bolt (eccentric shaft front) | 300–340 |  | New O-ring + sealant on pulley seating face. | 
| Oil pan upper block bolts | 18.6–25.5 |  | Apply sealant bead 2.5–6.5 mm around perimeter and specified bolt holes. |
| Oil pan bolts | 8.8–11.8 |  | Clean old sealant; apply continuous bead to mating surface. |
| Oil pan drain plug | 29.4–39.2 |  | Use new sealing washer. |
| Rear stationary gear stopper screw | 3.2–4.7 |  | Apply thread-locker; this retains the main bearing stop. |
