title: ToolSync — Digital Tracking Toolbox
---
The inspiration for my 4th-year project came from a challenge I frequently encounter: managing tools efficiently. Whether during my workday at a Van Conversion company or in my own workspace, I’ve noticed how much time and effort can be wasted searching for misplaced tools in cluttered or poorly designed storage systems.

This project aims to tackle that problem by designing an innovative tool storage solution. My goal is to create a system that not only organizes tools effectively but also improves accessibility and minimises downtime, offering a practical solution for professionals and hobbyists alike.

ToolSync is a smart toolbox designed to reduce lost time and misplaced tools.  
It pairs a heavy-duty tool chest with digital tracking and a Raspberry Pi–powered touchscreen interface.  
A passive HF RFID reader manages check-in/out, while small BLE tags (*SyncTags*) attached to each tool can flash or beep when a tool goes missing.
